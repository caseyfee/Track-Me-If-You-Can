# Track-Me-If-You-Can
This application is a content management systems (CMS). It was built using a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Description: 
In this project, I created an example database for a company that would allow a user to see all the company's departments, roles, employees AND edit and add to each of those categories as well. This application was created using Node.js and a video below is submitted to show an example of how one might go through the database. The database is saved in schemas on github. The link to it is below.
